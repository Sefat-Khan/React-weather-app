# Weather App

This project is a simple Weather App built using React. It provides the current weather and a weekly forecast for a specified location. The app dynamically displays weather details, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, weather condition, and rain chance, with background images that change based on the weather conditions.

# Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project locally.

# Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js] (v14 or later)
- [npm] [or] [Yarn]

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Sefat-Khan/React-weather-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd weather-app

3. Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install

4. Add API keys: Add your weather API key in the .env file to fetch real-time weather data from a weather API provider such as [@OpenWeatherMap] or any other.

5. Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start

This will run the app in development mode on http://localhost:3000.

# Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- [View] [the] [current] [weather] [conditions], [including] [temperature,] [wind] [speed,] [humidity,] [and] [rain] [chance].

- [See] [the] [upcoming] [weather] [forecast].

- [The] [background] [image] [changes] [based] [on] [the] [current] [weather].

# How to Use

1. You can update the location via the state context or integrate a search feature to input the desired city.

2. Weather data and icons are fetched dynamically from an API.
